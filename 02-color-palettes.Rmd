# How to choose colors in BetterVis {#colors}

## Written at the beginning

The BetterVis philosophy for color selection is based on simplicity and consistency. This is particularly suitable for researchers who do not want to spend excessive time on color coordination. 

To use these features, the BetterVis functions must be loaded beforehand (which is done in the `index.Rmd` setup chunk for this book). In a real session, you would load the package:

```r
# library(BetterVis)
```

## Usage example

### Discrete And Unpaired color selection

This is for when you have distinct categories that are not related.

```r
unpaired_colors <- BetterVis_Color(type = "discrete", odd_or_even = "even",  n = 10, style = "Science", option = 1)
scales::show_col(unpaired_colors)
```

### Discrete And paired color selection

This is useful when you have grouped data, for example, "before" and "after" measurements for several groups.

```r
paired_colors <- BetterVis_Color(type = "discrete", odd_or_even = "even",  n = 6, style = "Science", option = 2, paired = TRUE, pair_num = 2)
scales::show_col(paired_colors)
```

### Continuous color extraction

This generates a color gradient, perfect for heatmaps or variables that change along a spectrum.

```r
continuous_colors <- BetterVis_Color(type = "continuous", n = 9, style = "Nature", option = 1)
scales::show_col(continuous_colors)
```

Each of these function calls will return a vector of color hex codes based on your specifications. For example, the `unpaired_colors` object contains:
```
#> [1] "#377eb8" "#4daf4a" "#984ea3" "#ff7f00" "#ffff33" "#a65628" "#f781bf"
#> [8] "#999999" "#e41a1c" "#d7191c"
```

## Parameter explanation

**`type`**: The type of color scale. Accepts `"discrete"` for categorical data or `"continuous"` for numerical data. Default: `NULL`.

**`odd_or_even`**: Specifies whether the total number of colors to be generated should be odd or even. Accepts `"odd"` or `"even"`. Default: `NULL`.

**`n`**: A numeric value specifying the total number of colors to retrieve.

**`style`**: The color theme to use. Available options are `"Science"`, `"Nature"`, `"Cell"`, and `"Lancet"`.

**`option`**: A numeric value (1, 2, or 3) specifying the color scheme variation within the selected `style`.

**`paired`**: A logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) indicating whether to generate colors for paired/grouped data. If `TRUE`, colors are repeated in groups (e.g., `c("#984ea3", "#984ea3", "#ff7f00", "#ff7f00")`).

**`pair_num`**: If `paired = TRUE`, this sets the number of items within each color group. For example, if `n=6` and `pair_num=3`, the result would be three instances of the first color followed by three instances of the second. Default: `3`.
