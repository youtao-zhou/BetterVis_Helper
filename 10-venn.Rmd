# Venn and Upset Plots {#venn}

## At the Beginning
```r
# library(BetterVis)
```

## BetterVis_Venn_UpsetR

While traditional Venn diagrams are common, they become difficult to read with many sets. UpSet plots are a more powerful method for visualizing multi-set intersections.

### Data Input
```r
# Create sample data
# In your project: data("BetterVis_Venn_UpsetR_example", package="BetterVis")
set.seed(123)
listInput <- list(
  one = sample(1:30, 15),
  two = sample(1:30, 15),
  three = sample(1:30, 20),
  four = sample(1:30, 12),
  five = sample(1:30, 18)
)
```

### Simple Example
```r
# Note: eval=FALSE as the function is not provided in user files
BetterVis_Venn_UpsetR(listInput, all_text_adjust = 2)
```

### Advanced Example
```r
# Note: eval=FALSE as the function is not provided in user files
BetterVis_Venn_UpsetR(listInput, ratio = c(0.7,0.3),
                      y.label = "Intersection size", x.label = "Set Size",
                      main.bar.color = "#FCB2AF", sets.bar.color = "#9BDFDF", matrix.color = "#8C9FCA",
                      point.size = 3, line.size=1,
                      all_text_adjust = c(1.5, 1.2, 1.5, 1.2, 1.5, 1.5))
```
